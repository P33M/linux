 * This FIQ implements functionality that performs split transactions on
 * the dwc_otg hardware without any outside intervention. A split transaction
 * is "queued" by nominating a specific host channel to perform the entirety
 * of a split transaction. This FIQ will then perform the microframe-precise
 * scheduling required in each phase of the transaction until completion.
 *
 * The FIQ functionality has been surgically implanted into the Synopsys
 * vendor-provided driver.
